This app is built on Angularjs  to demonstrate some angular / js / html / css / gulp and others knowledge. And also as a simple playground of some other code.

## Overview

### Requirements
Node installed.  
All other handeled with node.

### Install, Run dev server
nmp install  
gulp serve  

### Build
gulp build

### The project uses a lot of
* Angularjs 1.5.x
* NPM / Bower asset managment
* Gulp for internal development pipeline, also on codeship for CI and CD.
* Deployment on Heroku

## About the project
### Requirements of the project
+ Write tests for you code «I will automate testing on CI»
+ Include a build process «taken care by Gulp»
+ Do not use any scaffolding tool or application boilerplate «All by hand, but used a lot of things I already use in my projects»
+ Do not use any CSS framework (i.e. Bootstrap, Foundation, or similar) «Just using Sass and Gulp to compile my CSS»
+ Use a CSS preprocessor «Sass as scss»
+ The site must work fine with the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge and IE11 «I will do my best, still hates EDGE and IE11»
+ Include a README file in which you explain your solution «here»

### Additional instructions
+ Use of design patterns would be a plus
+ Use of JS modules would be a plus
+ Use of caching and local storage would be a plus
+ You may use libraries such as icon packs (font-awesome etc)
+ Make your best judgement on font files
+ Add anything else that could make us say wow!
